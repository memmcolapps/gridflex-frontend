# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# Base API URL for all backend services
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://sbctest.memmserve.com:8081/grid-flex/v1/api

# Custom header for API authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_HEADER=your_custom_header_here

# HES Real-time Data SSE API Configuration (Optional - using base URL above)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/sse
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_RECONNECT_INTERVAL=5000
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS=3
